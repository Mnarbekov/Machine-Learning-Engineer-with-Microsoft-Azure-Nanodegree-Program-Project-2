# Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure – Project 2

In the Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure – Project 2, I was configuring a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploying it, and consuming the model via the endpoint.
I was using the Bank Marketing dataset (which was used in Project 1). I prepared a screencast video and screenshots.

In this project, I have completed (or attempt to complete) the following steps:
•	Authentication
•	Automated ML Experiment
•	Deploy the best model
•	Enable logging
•	Swagger Documentation
•	Consume model endpoints
•	Create and publish a pipeline (issue with the script provided – issue raised to the support)


## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 


## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps.
